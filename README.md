## 🔑 Role Selection (Demo Access)
The application uses a simple role selection mechanism to simulate different user views.

Users can select their role using a dropdown:
- Client
- Support

This approach is used for demonstration purposes.  
In a production system, this can be replaced with a proper login and authentication mechanism.
